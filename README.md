# Make JPEG droplet

This macOS droplet converts compatible image files into JPEGs. Set the compression quality by changing the number in the filename. I always have three copies on my desktop:

- Jpeg 60
- Jpeg 80
- Jpeg 100

## Create your first droplet

- Open `MakeJpeg 60.applescript` in Script Editor
- File > Export
- File Format > Application
- Save
- Make copies
- Set the compression quality by changing the number in each filename

## Compatible formats

Droplets accept PhotoShop files or anything with one of the following extensions:

- tif
- tiff
- png
- pict
- pct
- pdf
- bmp
- eps
- psd
